This is an example project that illustrates test driven development (TDD) practice 
and advantages of test driven design.

Most of the code and idea to use perfect numbers as an example was got from the book 
"The Productive Programmer by Neal Ford. Copyright 2008 Neal Ford, 978-00-596-51978-0".
This is incredible book. I recommend it to every developer.
